# Project_Yellow
One of the first White-bellied Sholakili to be ringed in 2018 by Bird Lab (skyisland.in) - with a yellow ring - and as you can see, the name has stuck on. I am the unofficial lab mascot because my territory is right outside their dorm door.

This repo contains scripts and methods used to assemble and visualize Yellow's genome through short read sequencing and reference guided scaffolding. 

Project conceptualised and executed by Vinay KL
